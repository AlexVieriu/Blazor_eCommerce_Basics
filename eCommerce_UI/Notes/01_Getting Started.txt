2. ASP.NET Core Platform

HttpRequest is incapsulated in HttpContext logic.

-> middleware should be made according to the single resposibility principale

-> Asp.Net Core, the Web server is a console app that runs in a infinite loop while,
listening to Httprequests 

-> in .net core they are 3 app framework: MVC, RazorPages, Blazor
-> each of them have different types of Middleware


MVC web app or wep API :
-> model classes, razor views, controller methods

Razer pages:
-> razor view, coresponde code behind model classes

Blazor pages:
-> blazor components(razor components)


3. How a Blazor App is Bootstrapped


-- Program.cs --

.Run() -> runs in a infinite loop and listen to HttpRequests and process the request 


-- Startup.cs

ConfigureServecies	: dependincy injection -> inject all of the dependences that the middleware uses
Configure			: middleware

app.UseEndpoints(...) -> here we configure our blazor middleware

endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host") : map all request to this Host page !!!

-> blazor app framework is a single page app framework


4. Understanding Project Structure

_Host.cshtml	-> the entry point of our blazor app
App.razor		-> the route component

-- App.razor --

<Route AppAssembly="typeof(Program).Assembly"	: we are running in this Assembly
<Found Context="routeData">						: if it find the location of the user request, then it will 
													display the main layout component								

<RouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)" />

-- MainLayout.razor

@body -> all our future components will be display in the @body placeholder


5. Adding Dynamic Content


6. View, State and Event - the Three Main Aspects

State-> View -> Event -> State -> .... 

State :

private string Title
private string Content

View :

<h3> @title <h3/>
<h3> @content <h3/>


Event: 

private void ServerClick()		{ ... }
private void WebAssemblyClick()	{ ... }s
